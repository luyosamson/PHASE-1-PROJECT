				FOODIN
This is an end of  phase 1 project developed during Moringa School Bootcamp.It is a single page website developed using three
technologies namely HTML,CSS AND javaScript.It has been hosted on the gh pages accessible through the link provided below.

				PROJECT DESCRIPTION
				
FoodIn website is a website developed for a restaurant to allow customers/clients order food,while within the restaurant or
away from the restaurant.The restaurant is to be responsible for delivery.Ordering while within the restaurant is aimed at enabling the 
restaurant serve a large number of customer efficiently and quickly without the customer having to wait for the 
waiter to attend to them incase there is a huge number of customer to be attended to.
I decided to use the three technologies(HTML,CSS and JavaScript) to enable me put what I had learned in the Bootcamp
during phase 0 and phase 1 into practice,and that is the main reason I created this website.
The project uses Foodish API to get random food images.

				CHALLENGES FACED
The main problem I encountred was how to fetch data from the API to my website.
Through different sources of resources,I managed to overcome the challenge and hence I integrated the API into my 
application.

				MODULES
This section tends to explain different section of the website from header to footer.

	i)Home page
	
This is the first page a user enconter when he/she log into the website,it display the special dishes offered 
by the restautant at that particular week.The animation has been enabled by JavaScript.

	ii)Popular Dishes
	
This is the section which entails the menu of the restaurant.In this section,a user can view the food and order instantly 
The images used here are imported images from the internet.

	iii)Today's special dish.
This section display special dish for that particular day.This food is to be offered at a discounted rate.
This is the section which uses the Foodish API.The images appearing here are fetched and randomly displayed on the page.
Anytime a page is refreshed,a new image of food is likely to appear.
When loading the page for the first time,the image is likely to take time to load and be rendered on the HTML page.
However,subsequent loading doesn't experience the above problem.

	iv)Order Now
This section provides the user with the instant form to fill when ordering the food.

	v)About Us
This section give the users a brief description of services offered by  the restaurant.These entails quick delivery,
flexible payment methods and 24/7 operation model.

	vi)Footer
This section provide location,contacts of the restaurant,quick links for navigating the website and social media account for the restaurant.

				HOW TO INSTALL THE PROJECT
Since this is a web based project,the only requirement for its use is having browser installed in user's device and internet access.
This makes it flexible since user has not to worry about system requirement that would have come up with the installation 
of the application.

				CREDIT
I take this opportunity to acknowledge my technical mentor BEATRICE WAMBUI.It is from her superb lecture and guidance that
I got the skill in the three technologies I used to model this website.
I also give credit to MDN JavaScript resource creator whose resources was vital in boosting my understanding of JavaScript.
